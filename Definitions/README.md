# What is this?
This directory contains inputs for [Elsa](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Violet/Sources/Elsa) (our code generation tool).

# Quick tips
- Use Haskell syntax highlighting
- Use block comments (`{-` and `-}`) for Elsa comments
- Use single line comments (`--`) to produce Swift documentation

For more information read the README inside the [Elsa](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Violet/Sources/Elsa) module.

# How to run?
Just type `make elsa` in root directory (it will compile and run 'Elsa' module from `./Sources/Elsa`).
