Tests written in Python taken from [RustPython](https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython).

There are 2 special directories:
- NOT_IMPLEMENTED - tests for things that are not yet implemented (like comprehensions)
- NOT_IMPLEMENTED_MODULES - tests for Python modules (which we don't have, since we implement only the core language)
