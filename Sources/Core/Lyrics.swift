    The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
    Not a footprint to be seen
    A kingdom of isolation
    And it looks like I'm the queen

    The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
    Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

    Don't let them in, don't let them see
    Be the good girl you always have to be
    Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
    Well, now they know

    Let it go, let it go
    Can't hold it back anymore
    Let it go, let it go
    Turn away and slam the door

    I don't care
    What they're going to say
    Let the storm rage on
    The cold never bothered me anyway

    It's funny how some distance
    Makes everything seem small
    And the fears that once controlled me
    Can't get to me at all

    It's time to see what I can do
    To test the limits and break through
    No right, no wrong, no rules for me
    I'm free

    Let it go, let it go
    I am one with the wind and sky
    Let it go, let it go
    You'll never see me cry
    Here I stand and here I'll stay
    Let the storm rage on

    My power flurries through the air into the ground
    My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
    And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
    I'm never going back, the past is in the past

    Let it go, let it go
    And I'll rise like the break of dawn
    Let it go, let it go
    That perfect girl is gone
    Here I stand in the light of day
    Let the storm rage on
    The cold never bothered me anyway

    Way back in days of old
    There was a legend told
    About a hero known as Galavant
    Square jaw and perfect hair
    Cojones out to there
    There was no hero quite like Galavant

    Tough, plus every other manly value
    Mess with him, he'll disembowel you
    Yay, he ruled in every way
    A fairy-tale cliche
    And people called him Galavant

    The man we're speaking of
    He had a lady love
    And Madalena, she was one fair maiden
    Long legs and perfect skin
    A body built for sin
    With cleavage you could hold a whole parade in

    Ah, true love was never this ecstatic
    Nor as wildly acrobatic
    Yes! He loved her to excess
    Thrice daily more or less
    And she'd be screaming, "Galavant!"

    One tiny problem soon would arise:
    Richard, a nearby king of wealth and stature
    He watched Madalena, lust in his eyes
    And he asked her for her hand
    Well, more like a demand
    Well, more like had his henchmen snatch her

    Which brings us to today
    The royal wedding day
    No one can stop it now but Galavant
    Poor Madalena waits
    Behind King Richard's gates
    For the arrival of her Galavant

    Now, at last, begins our true adventure
    Epic, wild, a real butt-clencher!
    So, huzzah and tally ho!
    Sit back and here we go!
    Attend the tale of Galavant
