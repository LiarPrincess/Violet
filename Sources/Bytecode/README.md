# Bytecode

This module contains VM instructions.

See “Documentation” directory in `<repository-root>` for more details.

## Important files

- `Generated/Instruction.swift` - VM instructions generated by [Elsa](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Violet/tree/main/Sources/Elsa) from [Definitions/opcodes.letitgo](https://github.com/LiarPrincess/Violet/tree/main/Elsa%20definitions). Each instruction has exactly 2 bytes (just like in CPython).
- `CodeObject` - container for `Instructions`. It will also contain some additional information like: `class` name, constants, variable names etc.
- `CodeObjectBuilder` - helper for creating new `CodeObjects` (mostly dealing with appending new instructions).
- `PeepholeOptimizer.swift` - small optimizations within a single code object. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization) article.
