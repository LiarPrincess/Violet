# What is this?

Helper for our implementation of `float.fromhex`.
This is basically a code from CPython + [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) + some polyfills.

# How to run?

Run following command from the repository root:

> ./Scripts/float_from_hex/main.sh

Btw. `clang` is required (but that should not be a problem).
