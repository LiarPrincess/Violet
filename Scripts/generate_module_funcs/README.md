# What is this?
This script generates Swift code for module functions using module html documentation.
Is is by no means perfect, but it is way better than writing this by hand.

# Examples
Input: `site-builtins.html`
Output: `result-builtins.swift`

# How to run?
Just run `python3 ./Scripts/generate_module_funcs` from root dir.
