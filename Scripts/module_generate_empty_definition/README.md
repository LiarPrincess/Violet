# What is this?

This script generates Swift code for module functions using module html documentation.
Is is not perfect, but it is way better than writing this by hand.

# Examples

Input: `site-builtins.html`
Output: `result-builtins.swift`

# How to run?

Run following command from the repository root:

> python3 ./Scripts/module_generate_empty_definition
